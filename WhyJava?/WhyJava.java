// Java is a class-based programming language.
// This means that the code you write must be placed inside a class.
// The class is the blueprint for the object.
// The class name must match the file name.
// THE MAIN METHOD
// The main method must be defined inside a class.
// The main method is the entry point of the program.
// The main method is where the program starts executing.
// The main method must be declared as public, static, and void.
// The main method must accept an array of strings as a parameter.
// The main method must be named main.
